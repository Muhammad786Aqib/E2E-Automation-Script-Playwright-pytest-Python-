To create an end-to-end (E2E) automation script using Playwright with Pytest in Python, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
Python: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from here.

Playwright: Install the Playwright library.

Pytest: Install Pytest for test automation.

Step-by-step Guide
1. Install Required Packages
Run the following command to install the necessary packages:


pip install pytest playwright
After installing the libraries, you need to install the browser binaries for Playwright:

python -m playwright install
This will download the necessary browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) for Playwright.

2. Create Your Test Script
Now, you can create a test script for your E2E automation. Create a directory for your project, and inside that directory, create a Python file for your tests, such as test_e2e.py.

3. Running the Test with Pytest
You can now run the test with the following command:
pytest test_e2e.py
